Disk is a **powerful** and **simple** file management library built with Apple's [iOS Data Storage Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/documentation/data-storage/index.html) in mind. Disk uses the new `Codable` protocol introduced in Swift 4 to its utmost advantage and gives you the power to persist structs without ever having to worry about encoding/decoding. Disk also helps you save images and other data types to disk with as little as one line of code.

## Compatibility

Disk requires **iOS 9+** and is compatible with projects using **Swift 4.0** and above. Therefore you must use at least Xcode 9 when working with Disk.

## Installation

* <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html" target="_blank">CocoaPods</a>:

Disk supports [CocoaPods 1.7.0's new multi-Swift feature](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-1.7.0-beta/) for Swift 4.0, 4.2, and 5.0. Simply specify `supports_swift_versions` in your Podfile.

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
target 'ProjectName' do
use_frameworks!
supports_swift_versions '< 5.0' # configure this for your project

    pod 'Disk', '~> 0.6.4'

end
```
*(if you run into problems, `pod repo update` and try again)*

* <a href="https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage" target="_blank">Carthage</a>:

 ```ruby
 github "saoudrizwan/Disk"
 ```

* <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager" target="_blank">Swift Package Manager</a>:

```
dependencies: [
    .Package(url: "https://github.com/saoudrizwan/Disk.git", "0.6.4")
]
```

* Or embed the Disk framework into your project

And `import Disk` in the files you'd like to use it.

## Usage

Disk currently supports persistence of the following types:

* `Codable`
* `[Codable]`
* `UIImage`
* `[UIImage]`
* `Data`
* `[Data]`

*These are generally the only types you'll ever need to persist on iOS.*

Disk follows Apple's [iOS Data Storage Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/documentation/data-storage/index.html) and therefore allows you to save files in four primary directories and shared containers:

#### Documents Directory `.documents`

> Only documents and other data that is **user-generated, or that cannot otherwise be recreated by your application**, should be stored in the `<Application_Home>/Documents` directory and will be automatically backed up by iCloud.

#### Caches Directory `.caches`

> Data that **can be downloaded again or regenerated** should be stored in the `<Application_Home>/Library/Caches` directory. Examples of files you should put in the Caches directory include database cache files and downloadable content, such as that used by magazine, newspaper, and map applications.
>
> Use this directory to write any application-specific support files that you want to persist between launches of the application or during application updates. **Your application is generally responsible for adding and removing these files** (see [Helper Methods](#helper-methods)). It should also be able to re-create these files as needed because iTunes removes them during a full restoration of the device. In iOS 2.2 and later, the contents of this directory are not backed up by iTunes.
>
> Note that the system may delete the Caches/ directory to free up disk space, so your app must be able to re-create or download these files as needed.

#### Application Support Directory `.applicationSupport`

> Put app-created support files in the `<Application_Home>/Library/Application Support` directory. In general, this directory includes files that the app uses to run but that should remain hidden from the user. This directory can also include data files, configuration files, templates and modified versions of resources loaded from the app bundle.

#### Temporary Directory `.temporary`

> Data that is used only temporarily should be stored in the `<Application_Home>/tmp` directory. Although these files are not backed up to iCloud, remember to delete those files when you are done with them so that they do not continue to consume space on the user’s device.

#### Application Group Shared Container `.sharedContainer(appGroupName: String)`

Multiple applications on a single device can access a shared directory, as long as these apps have the same `groupIdentifier` in the `com.apple.security.application-groups` entitlements array, as described in [Adding an App to an App Group](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/EntitlementKeyReference/Chapters/EnablingAppSandbox.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011195-CH4-SW19) in [Entitlement Key Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/EntitlementKeyReference/Chapters/AboutEntitlements.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011195).

For more information, visit the documentation: [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsfilemanager/1412643-containerurlforsecurityapplicati](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsfilemanager/1412643-containerurlforsecurityapplicati)

---

With all these requirements and best practices, it can be hard working with the iOS file system appropriately, which is why Disk was born. Disk makes following these tedious rules simple and fun.

### Using Disk is easy.

Disk handles errors by `throw`ing them. See [Handling Errors Using Do-Catch](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ErrorHandling.html).

### Structs (must conform to [`Codable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable))

Let's say we have a data model called `Message`...
```swift
struct Message: Codable {
    let title: String
    let body: String
}
```
... and we want to persist a message to disk...
```swift
let message = Message(title: "Hello", body: "How are you?")
```
```swift
try Disk.save(message, to: .caches, as: "message.json")
```
... or maybe we want to save it in a folder...
```swift
try Disk.save(message, to: .caches, as: "Folder/message.json")
```
... we might then want to retrieve this message later...
```swift
let retrievedMessage = try Disk.retrieve("Folder/message.json", from: .caches, as: Message.self)
```
If you Option + click `retrievedMessage`, then Xcode will show its type as `Message`. Pretty neat, huh?
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7799382/28643842-0ab38230-720c-11e7-8bf4-33ce329068d1.png" alt="example">

So what happened in the background? Disk first converts `message` to JSON data and [atomically writes](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8548318/3502608) that data to a newly created file at `<Application_Home>/Library/Caches/Folder/message.json`. Then when we retrieve the `message`, Disk automatically converts the JSON data to our `Codable` struct type.

**What about arrays of structs?**

Thanks to the power of `Codable`, storing and retrieving arrays of structs is just as easy as the code above.
```swift
var messages = [Message]()
for i in 0..<5 {
    messages.append(Message(title: "\(i)", body: "..."))
}
```
```swift
try Disk.save(messages, to: .caches, as: "messages.json")
```
```swift
let retrievedMessages = try Disk.retrieve("messages.json", from: .caches, as: [Message].self)
```

**Appending structs** *(Thank you for the suggestion [@benpackard](https://github.com/saoudrizwan/Disk/issues/4))*

Disk also allows you to append a struct or array of structs to a file with data of the same type.
```swift
try Disk.append(newMessage, to: "messages.json", in: .caches)
```
**Note:** you may append a single struct to an empty file, but then in order to properly retrieve that struct again, you must retrieve it as an array.

**Using custom `JSONEncoder` or `JSONDecoder`** *(Thank you [@nixzhu](https://github.com/saoudrizwan/Disk/pull/16) and [@mecid](https://github.com/saoudrizwan/Disk/pull/28))*

Behind the scenes, Disk uses Apple's [`JSONEncoder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsonencoder) and [`JSONDecoder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsondecoder) classes to encode and decode raw JSON data. You can use custom instances of these classes if you require special encoding or decoding strategies for example.
```swift
let encoder = JSONEncoder()
encoder.keyEncodingStrategy = .convertToSnakeCase
try Disk.save(messages, to: .caches, as: "messages.json", encoder: encoder)
```
```swift
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
decoder.keyDecodingStrategy = .convertFromSnakeCase
let retrievedMessages = try Disk.retrieve("messages.json", from: .caches, as: [Message].self, decoder: decoder)
```
**Note:** appending a `Codable` structure requires Disk to first decode any existing values at the file location, append the new value, then encode the resulting structure to that location.
```swift
try Disk.append(newMessage, to: "messages.json", in: .caches, decoder: decoder, encoder: encoder)
```

### Images
```swift
let image = UIImage(named: "nature.png")
```
```swift
try Disk.save(image, to: .documents, as: "Album/nature.png")
```
```swift
let retrievedImage = try Disk.retrieve("Album/nature.png", from: .documents, as: UIImage.self)
```

**Array of images**

Multiple images are saved to a new folder. Each image is then named 0.png, 1.png, 2.png, etc.
```swift
var images = [UIImages]()
// ...
```
```swift
try Disk.save(images, to: .documents, as: "FolderName/")
```
You don't need to include the "/" after the folder name, but doing so is declarative that you're not writing all the images' data to one file, but rather as several files to a new folder.
```swift
let retrievedImages = try Disk.retrieve("FolderName", from: .documents, as: [UIImage].self)
```
Let's say you saved a bunch of images to a folder like so:
```swift
try Disk.save(deer, to: .documents, as: "Nature/deer.png")
try Disk.save(lion, to: .documents, as: "Nature/lion.png")
try Disk.save(bird, to: .documents, as: "Nature/bird.png")
```
And maybe you even saved a JSON file to this Nature folder:
```swift
try Disk.save(diary, to: .documents, as: "Nature/diary.json")
```
Then you could retrieve all the images in the Nature folder like so:
```swift
let images = try Disk.retrieve("Nature", from: .documents, as: [UIImage].self)
```
... which would return `-> [deer.png, lion.png, bird.png]`

**Appending images**

Unlike how appending a struct simply modifies an existing JSON file, appending an image adds that image as an independent file to a folder.
```swift
try Disk.append(goat, to: "Nature", in: .documents)
```
**Note:** it's recommended to manually save an independent image using the `save(:to:as:)` function in order to specify a name for that image file in case you want to retrieve it later. Using the `append(:to:in:)` function results in creating a file with an auto-generated name (i.e. if you append an image to a folder with images already present (0.png, 1.png, 2.png), then the new image will be named 3.png.) If the image name is not important, then using `append(:to:in:)` is fine. Appending arrays of images is similar in behavior.

### Data

If you're trying to save data like .mp4 video data for example, then Disk's methods for `Data` will help you work with the file system to persist all data types.

```swift
let videoData = Data(contentsOf: videoURL, options: [])
```
```swift
try Disk.save(videoData, to: .documents, as: "anime.mp4")
```
```swift
let retrievedData = try Disk.retrieve("anime.mp4", from: .documents, as: Data.self)
```
**Array of `Data`**

Disk saves arrays of `Data` objects like it does arrays of images, as files in a folder.
```swift
var data = [Data]()
// ...
```
```swift
try Disk.save(data, to: .documents, as: "videos")
```
```swift
let retrievedVideos = try Disk.retrieve("videos", from: .documents, as: [Data].self)
```
If you were to retrieve `[Data]` from a folder with images and JSON files, then those files would be included in the returned value. Continuing the example from the [Array of images](#images) section:
```swift
let files = try Disk.retrieve("Nature", from: .documents, as: [Data].self)
```
... would return `-> [deer.png, lion.png, bird.png, diary.json]`

**Appending `Data`**

Appending `Data` or an array of `Data` is similar to appending an image or array of images—new files are created with auto-generated names and added to the specified folder.
```swift
try Disk.append(newDataObject, to: "Folder/", in: .documents)
```

### Large files
It's important to know when to work with the file system on the background thread. Disk is **synchronous**, giving you more control over read/write operations on the file system. [Apple says](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/TechniquesforReadingandWritingCustomFiles/TechniquesforReadingandWritingCustomFiles.html) that *"because file operations involve accessing the disk, performing those operations **asynchronously** is almost always preferred."*

[Grand Central Dispatch](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch) is the best way to work with Disk asynchronously. Here's an example:
```swift
activityIndicator.startAnimating()
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {
    do {
        try Disk.save(largeData, to: .documents, as: "Movies/spiderman.mp4")
    } catch {
        // ...
    }
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        activityIndicator.stopAnimating()
        // ...
    }
}
```
*Don't forget to handle these sorts of tasks [being interrupted](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18305715/3502608).*

### iOS 11 Volume Information
Apple introduced several great iOS storage practices in [Session 204](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/fall2017/204/), putting emphasis on several new `NSURL` volume capacity details added in iOS 11. This information allows us to gauge when it's appropriate to store data on the user's disk.

* Total capacity
```swift
Disk.totalCapacity
```

* Available capacity
```swift
Disk.availableCapacity
```

* Available capacity for important usage. This indicates the amount of space that can be made available  for things the user has explicitly requested in the app's UI (i.e. downloading a video or new level for a game.)
```swift
Disk.availableCapacityForImportantUsage
```

* Available capacity for opportunistic usage. This indicates the amount of space available for things that the user is likely to want but hasn't explicitly requested (i.e. next episode in video series they're watching, or recently updated documents in a server that they might be likely to open.)
```swift
Disk.availableCapacityForOpportunisticUsage
```

**Note:** These variables return Optional `Int`s since retrieving file system resource values may fail and return `nil`. However this is very unlikely to happen, and this behavior exists solely for safety purposes.

### Helper Methods

* Clear an entire directory
```swift
try Disk.clear(.caches)
```

* Remove a file/folder
```swift
try Disk.remove("video.mp4", from: .documents)
```

* Check if file/folder exists
```swift
if Disk.exists("album", in: .documents) {
    // ...
}
```
* Move a file/folder to another directory
```swift
try Disk.move("album/", in: .documents, to: .caches)
```
* Rename a file/folder
```swift
try Disk.rename("currentName.json", in: .documents, to: "newName.json")
```
* Get file system URL for a file/folder
```swift
let url = try Disk.url(for: "album/", in: .documents)
```
* Mark a file/folder with the `do not backup` attribute (this keeps the file/folder on disk even in low storage situations, but prevents it from being backed up by iCloud or iTunes.)
```swift
try Disk.doNotBackup("album", in: .documents)
```
> Everything in your app’s home directory is backed up, **with the exception of the application bundle itself, the caches directory, and temporary directory.**
```swift
try Disk.backup("album", in: .documents)
```
(You should generally never use the `.doNotBackup(:in:)` and `.backup(:in:)` methods unless you're absolutely positive you want to persist data no matter what state the user's device is in.)

#### `URL` Counterparts
Most of these helper methods have `URL` counterparts, in case you want to work with files directly with their file system URLs.

```swift
let fileUrl = try Disk.url(for: "file.json", in: .documents)
```

* Remove a file/folder
```swift
try Disk.remove(fileUrl)
```

* Check if file/folder exists
```swift
if Disk.exists(fileUrl) {
    // ...
}
```
* Move a file/folder to another directory
```swift
let newUrl = try Disk.url(for: "Folder/newFileName.json", in: .documents)
try Disk.move(fileUrl, to: newUrl)
```

* Mark a file/folder with the `do not backup` attribute
```swift
try Disk.doNotBackup(fileUrl)
```
```swift
try Disk.backup(fileUrl)
```

* Check if URL is of a folder
```swift
if Disk.isFolder(fileUrl) {
    // ...
}
```

## Debugging

Disk is *thorough*, meaning that it will not leave an error to chance. Almost all of Disk's methods throw errors either on behalf of `Foundation` or custom Disk Errors that are worth bringing to your attention. These errors have a lot of information, such as a description, failure reason, and recovery suggestion:
```swift
do {
    if Disk.exists("posts.json", in: .documents) {
        try Disk.remove("posts.json", from: .documents)
    }
} catch let error as NSError {
    fatalError("""
        Domain: \(error.domain)
        Code: \(error.code)
        Description: \(error.localizedDescription)
        Failure Reason: \(error.localizedFailureReason ?? "")
        Suggestions: \(error.localizedRecoverySuggestion ?? "")
        """)
}
```
The example above takes care of the most common error when dealing with the file system: removing a file that doesn't exist.

## A Word from the Developer

After developing for iOS for 8+ years, I've come across almost every method of data persistence there is to offer (Core Data, Realm, `NSKeyedArchiver`, `UserDefaults`, etc.) Nothing really fit the bill except `NSKeyedArchiver`, but there were too many hoops to jump through. After Swift 4 was released, I was really excited about the `Codable` protocol because I knew what it had to offer in terms of JSON coding. Working with network responses' JSON data and converting them to usable structures has never been easier. **Disk aims to extend that simplicity of working with data to the file system.**

Let's say we get some data back from a network request...
```swift
let _ = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { (data, response, error) in
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        guard error == nil else { fatalError(error!.localizedDescription) }
        guard let data = data else { fatalError("No data retrieved") }

        // ... we could directly save this data to disk...
        try? Disk.save(data, to: .caches, as: "posts.json")

    }
}.resume()
```
... and retrieve it later as `[Post]`...
```swift
let posts = try Disk.retrieve("posts.json", from: .caches, as: [Post].self)
```

Disk takes out a lot of the tedious handy work required in coding data to the desired type, and it does it well. Disk also makes necessary but monotonous tasks simple, such as clearing out the caches or temporary directory (as required by Apple's [iOS Data Storage Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/documentation/data-storage/index.html)):

```swift
try Disk.clear(.temporary)
```
Disk is also [significantly faster than alternative persistence solutions like `NSKeyedArchiver`](https://twitter.com/JStheoriginal/status/924810983360434176), since it works directly with the file system.
Best of all, Disk is thorough when it comes to throwing errors, ensuring that you understand why a problem occurs when it does.
