 ðŸ’¾ Disk
 Easily work with the file system without worrying about any of its intricacies!
 
 - Save Codable structs, UIImage, [UIImage], Data, [Data] to Apple recommended locations on the user's disk, without having to worry about serialization.
 - Retrieve an object from disk as the type you specify, without having to worry about deserialization.
 - Remove specific objects from disk, clear entire directories if you need to, check if an object exists on disk, and much more!
 - Follow Apple's strict guidelines concerning persistence and using the file system easily.
